# Health_Insurance_Prediction

This classification project aims to determine if an individual possesses health insurance by employing various machine learning models and comparing their performance. The primary focus is on the "Response" variable.

The dataset utilized in this project was obtained from Kaggle and consists of 15 columns, including the target variable. It comprises a total of 2974 records.

To enhance data processing capabilities, I combined MongoDB with Spark.

I implemented Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest Classifier, and GBT Classifier as part of this project. Among these models, Random Forest Classifier exhibited the most favorable outcome, achieving a score of 0.625. Consequently, it may be beneficial to explore additional feature engineering techniques, experiment with data transformations, conduct a comprehensive analysis of the results, and gain insights in order to further enhance the score.
